## Intro

 - This is a quick test to see if you understand some react and typescript concepts. 

- There are 2 files to work in src/remove-duplicate-display.tsx and src/use-remove-duplicates.ts

- The goal is to update those 2 files and create a custom hook that takes a function and an array of numbers. Then returns the result of the function 

- The function should filter out duplicate items and return the remaining items

- Don't change any of the existing code

## Install and setup
